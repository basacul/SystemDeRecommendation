# Système de Recommendation

This project was written in Java and submitted as an assignment for the course "Introduction à la Programmation" by Jamila Sam at the EPFL in 2014.
The assignment was created by Jamila Sam and Barbara Jobstmann. We were asked to create a recommender system as used in Netflix, Amazon and other service providers. The project description can be found in [recommendation-sytems-fr.pdf](https://github.com/basacul/SystemeDeRecommendation/blob/master/recommendation_systems-fr.pdf) and the source file in [src/assignment/Recommendation.java](https://github.com/basacul/SystemeDeRecommendation/blob/master/src/assignment/Recommendation.java).
